For this project we we're asked to build a DFSM (Determinite Finite State Machine) using Java/C++. I included the instructions given from the class in the docx file.
In this design I used a sort of counting sort algorithm to build the machine based on the input. When a proper test file is provided, the program will build and run a
functional state machine.
